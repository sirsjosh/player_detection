# Football Player Detection Project

This project involves detecting and tracking football players in a video, assigning teams to players, and identifying ball possession using deep learning models and computer vision techniques. The main steps include reading a video, tracking objects (players and ball), assigning teams, and determining ball possession. The final output is an annotated video with players, their team colors, and ball possession.
